# Bank-Account
# 🏦 BankAccount Java Program

This Java program simulates simple banking operations for a user-selected account. It provides a console-based menu to interact with one of three hardcoded bank accounts. Users can deposit, withdraw, or check their account balance.

## 📌 Features

- **Object-Oriented Design** using a `BankAccount` class
- **Account Operations**:
  - Deposit money
  - Withdraw money (with balance check)
  - Check balance
- **Input Validation** to prevent negative deposits or overdrafts
- **Interactive CLI Menu** using Java `Scanner`

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Three bank accounts are initialized:
   - Stunning Steve Austin
   - Jacob Fatu
   - Seth Rollins

2. The user selects an account by entering a number (1–3).

3. A loop provides the following options:
   - `1`: Deposit
   - `2`: Withdraw
   - `3`: Check Balance
   - `4`: Exit

4. Input is accepted via the console, and the program responds accordingly.

## 🧪 Example

```bash
Enter (1: for Stunning Steve Austin, 2:Jacob Fatu, 3:Seth Rollins): 2
Welcome Jacob Fatu!
1:Deposit
2: Withdraw
3: Check Balance
4: Exit
Enter choice: 1
Enter amount to deposit: 5000
New balance: 40000

//This simulates simple bank functions like depositing, withdrawing and viewing their bank balances 
```
